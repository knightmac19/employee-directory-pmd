React application that returns employee data from an API and continuously filters the results as the user searches across multiple categories (name, DOB, phone, etc.).

### User Story
As a business manager I want the ability to instantly call up an employee's profile by searching across several categories.

### Usage
Users can view all employees, sort ascending/descending by last name, and filter across all categories by typing in the search bar.
